starter
=======
Starter enables start, restart, and stop servers built in Go.

Starter has been built to handle easily the services (daemons) instead of using
some archaic system like Debian's startup script which is much more complex and
it is not portable even among Linux distributions.

The operation is very simple. There is a function, Wait, that catches the
interruptions and sets a exit status code according to that interruption;
the function ExitStatus exits with such exit code. Finally, the command
"starter" --which has to run the service-- gets the exit code to proceed
according to it.

You can also stop or restart the service using CTRL-C.

## Example

This simple example shows the basic thing:

	}
