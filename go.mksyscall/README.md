go.mksyscall
============
Generate Windows system calls from function prototypes, for the Go language.

[Documentation online](http://godoc.org/github.com/tredoe/goutil/go.mksyscall)

It is based in "$GOROOT/src/pkg/syscall/mksyscall_windows.pl".

Since "mksyscall_windows.pl" (in "$GOROOT/src/pkg/syscall") is focused in
bootstrap Go I have built it in Go, so it can be also used by developers that
need to deal Windows system calls and they have not Perl installed.  
It is smarter than Perl's version because it creates automatically the files for
different architectures, when it is necessary.

Note that the code size is more than the double of the Perl's code size, but the
Go version uses a scanner to parsing the function prototypes.

The test renames the files generated by the Perl version to be generated by this
tool and compile Go, checking that the output generated is correct. Finally,
the old files are recovered.  
The compilation has demonstrated in my system that the files generated are correct.

Anyway, if you have some doubt, you can always check both outputs:

	$GOROOT/src/pkg/syscall/mksyscall_windows.pl      file.go > z[file]_amd64.go
	$GOROOT/src/pkg/syscall/mksyscall_windows.pl -l32 file.go > z[file]_386.go

	go.mksyscall -w file.go

having in mind that the Go version generates the files for the architectures
only when it is necessary.
